# README

## Setup

* Ruby 3.0.1
* Rails 7.0.4.3
* Run `bundle install`
* Run `rails server`
* You can use **Postman** to make a **GET** request to: `http://localhost:3000/lines/:id` and check results.
* Run `bundle exec rspec` to use the testing framework.

## Answers

* System works well, but I would like to run more tests. Especially with multiple access.
* I noticed request response getting a bit slower with larger files.
* I could not test multiple access properly.
* Rails Documentation and Medium articles about File and IO.
* This is a rails app, so it has everything it needs. I just added RSpec testing framework.
* I spent ~4 hours. 1 hour thinking over, 1 hour coding, 1 hour testing and 1 hour refactoring.
* With more time I would like to be sure that I choose the best way to access the file, test multiple accesses and design more tests with different scenarios. Maybe try to find a way to cache responses in order to speed up responses.
* That is difficult, do not know how to critique my own code, I just try to be simple, directly, clean and logical. I know there are fancy methods but I prefer simplicity, even with a bit more lines of codes.
